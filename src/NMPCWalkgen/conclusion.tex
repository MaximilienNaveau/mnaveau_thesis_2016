\section{CONCLUSIONS}

In this chapter we presented a real time non linear walking pattern generator.
Its input is any linear velocity on the ground plan and a rotational one around the gravity axis.
Its out is a feasible set of steps computed automatically and a feasible trajectory for the CoM.
It also include the possible to include non linear constraint like avoid the foot step to fall inside a circle.

An extension to 3D stepping stone would be possible by fusing the algorithm in \cite{Deits:ichr:14} and our pattern generator,
i.e using mixed integer solution to find suitable foot step surfaces and still being able to include potentially moving obstacles in the way.
