In this chapter we have demonstrated the capability of a humanoid robot to pull a fire hose.
%
However, as shown in Fig.~\ref{zmp_cont} the center of pressure of the robot is further and further from its reference as the robot pulls the hose.
%
One possible way to solve this problem is to take the external forces, in this case the hose on the wrist, into the walking pattern generator algorithm.
%
In the mathematical formulation of the walking patten generator external forces can be introduced as an additional acceleration on the center of mass.
%
Preliminary results have been shown in simulation Chap.~\ref{chap:nmpc} of this thesis.
As future work we will implement this force feedback on the real HRP-2.
