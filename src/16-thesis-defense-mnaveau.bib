We make use of a model predictive control (MPC) visual servoing strategy, which is combined to the walking motion generator. We define two schemes based on that principle: a position-based and an image-based scheme, with a Quadratic Program (QP) formulation in both cases. Finally, we present some simulation results validating our approach.</p>},

  abstract = {Curvature and tangential velocity of voluntary hand movements are
	constrained by an empirical relation known as the Two-Thirds Power
	Law. It has been argued that the law reflects the working of central
	control mechanisms, but it is not known whether these mechanisms
	are specific to the hand or shared also by other types of movement.
	Three experiments tested whether the power law applies to the smooth
	pursuit movements of the eye, which are controlled by distinct neural
	motor structures and a peculiar set of muscles. The first experiment
	showed that smooth pursuit of elliptic targets with various curvature-velocity
	relationships was most accurate when targets were compatible with
	the Two-Thirds Power Law. Tracking errors in all other cases reflected
	the fact that, irrespective of target kinematics, eye movements tended
	to comply with the law. Using only compatible targets, the second
	experiment demonstrated that kinematics per se cannot account for
	the pattern of pursuit errors. The third experiment showed that two-dimensional
	performance cannot be fully predicted on the basis of the performance
	observed when the horizontal and vertical components of the targets
	used in the first condition were tracked separately. We conclude
	that the Two-Thirds Power Law, in its various manifestations, reflects
	neural mechanisms common to otherwise distinct control modules.},

    ABSTRACT = { Hierarchical least-square optimization is often used in robotics to inverse a direct function when multiple incompatible objectives are involved. Typical examples are inverse kinematics or dynamics. The objectives can be given as equalities to be satisfied (e.g. point-to-point task) or as areas of satisfaction (e.g. the joint range). This paper proposes a complete solution to solve multiple least-square quadratic problems of both equality and inequality constraints ordered into a strict hierarchy. Our method is able to solve a hierarchy of only equalities 10 times faster than the iterative-projection hierarchical solvers and can consider inequalities at any level while running at the typical control frequency on whole-body size problems. This generic solver is used to resolve the redundancy of humanoid robots while generating complex movements in constrained environments. },

	minimum of the search time as a function of the typical times spent
	in each state, for the same optimal duration of the ballistic phase.
	This last quantity could be a universal feature of 2D intermittent
	search strategies.},

  abstract = {Human movements show several prominent features; movement duration
	is nearly independent of movement size (the isochrony principle),
	instantaneous speed depends on movement curvature (captured by the
	2/3 power law), and complex movements are composed of simpler elements
	(movement compositionality). No existing theory can successfully
	account for all of these features, and the nature of the underlying
	motion primitives is still unknown. Also unknown is how the brain
	selects movement duration. Here we present a new theory of movement
	timing based on geometrical invariance. We propose that movement
	duration and compositionality arise from cooperation among Euclidian,
	equi-affine and full affine geometries. Each geometry posses a canonical
	measure of distance along curves, an invariant arc-length parameter.
	We suggest that for continuous movements, the actual movement duration
	reflects a particular tensorial mixture of these canonical parameters.
	Near geometrical singularities, specific combinations are selected
	to compensate for time expansion or compression in individual parameters.
	The theory was mathematically formulated using Cartan's moving frame
	method. Its predictions were tested on three data sets: drawings
	of elliptical curves, locomotion and drawing trajectories of complex
	figural forms (cloverleaves, lemniscates and lima\c ons, with varying
	ratios between the sizes of the large versus the small loops). Our
	theory accounted well for the kinematic and temporal features of
	these movements, in most cases better than the constrained Minimum
	Jerk model, even when taking into account the number of estimated
	free parameters. During both drawing and locomotion equi-affine geometry
	was the most dominant geometry, with affine geometry second most
	important during drawing; Euclidian geometry was second most important
	during locomotion. We further discuss the implications of this theory:
	the origin of the dominance of equi-affine geometry, the possibility
	that the brain uses different mixtures of these geometries to encode
	movement duration and speed, and the ontogeny of such representations.},

  abstract = {Motor imagery, i.e., a mental state during which an individual internally
	represents an action without any overt motor output, is a potential
	tool to investigate action representation during development. Here,
	we took advantage of the inertial anisotropy phenomenon to investigate
	whether children can generate accurate motor predictions for movements
	with varying dynamics. Children (9 and 11 years), adolescents (14
	years) and young adults (21 years) carried-out actual and mental
	arm movements in two different directions in the horizontal plane:
	rightwards (low inertia) and leftwards (high inertia). We recorded
	and compared actual and mental movement times. We found that actual
	movement times were greater for leftward than rightward arm movements
	in all groups. For mental movements, differences between leftward
	versus rightward movements were observed in the adults and adolescents,
	but not among the children. Furthermore, significant differences
	between actual and mental times were found at 9 and 11 years of age
	in the leftward direction. The ratio R/L (rightward direction/leftward
	direction), which indicates temporal differences between low inertia
	and high inertia movements, was inferior to 1 at all ages, except
	for the mental movements at 9 years of age, indicating than actual
	and mental movements were shorter for the rightward than leftward
	direction. Interestingly, while the ratio R/L of actual movements
	was constant across ages, it gradually decreased with age for mental
	movements. The ratio A/M (actual movement/mental movement), which
	indicates temporal differences between actual and mental movements,
	was near to 1 in the adults' groups, denoting accurate mental timing.
	In children and adolescents, an underestimation of mental movement
	times appeared for the leftward movements only. However, this overestimation
	gradually decreased with age. Our results showed a refinement in
	the motor imagery ability during development. Action representation
	reached maturation at adolescence, during which mental actions were
	tightly related to their actual production.},

  abstract = {Behavioral and modeling studies have established that curved and drawing
	human hand movements obey the 2/3 power law, which dictates a strong
	coupling between movement curvature and velocity. Human motion perception
	seems to reflect this constraint. The functional MRI study reported
	here demonstrates that the brain's response to this law of motion
	is much stronger and more widespread than to other types of motion.
	Compliance with this law is reflected in the activation of a large
	network of brain areas subserving motor production, visual motion
	processing, and action observation functions. Hence, these results
	strongly support the notion of similar neural coding for motion perception
	and production. These findings suggest that cortical motion representations
	are optimally tuned to the kinematic and geometrical invariants characterizing
	biological actions.},

  abstract = {Humans interact with their environment through sensory information
	and motor actions. These interactions may be understood via the underlying
	geometry of both perception and action. While the motor space is
	typically considered by default to be Euclidean, persistent behavioral
	observations point to a different underlying geometric structure.
	These observed regularities include the "two-thirds power law", which
	connects path curvature with velocity, and "local isochrony", which
	prescribes the relation between movement time and its extent. Starting
	with these empirical observations, we have developed a mathematical
	framework based on differential geometry, Lie group theory and Cartan's
	moving frame method for the analysis of human hand trajectories.
	We also use this method to identify possible motion primitives, i.e.,
	elementary building blocks from which more complicated movements
	are constructed. We show that a natural geometric description of
	continuous repetitive hand trajectories is not Euclidean but equi-affine.
	Specifically, equi-affine velocity is piecewise constant along movement
	segments, and movement execution time for a given segment is proportional
	to its equi-affine arc-length. Using this mathematical framework,
	we then analyze experimentally recorded drawing movements. To examine
	movement segmentation and classification, the two fundamental equi-affine
	differential invariants-equi-affine arc-length and curvature are
	calculated for the recorded movements. We also discuss the possible
	role of conic sections, i.e., curves with constant equi-affine curvature,
	as motor primitives and focus in more detail on parabolas, the equi-affine
	geodesics. Finally, we explore possible schemes for the internal
	neural coding of motor commands by showing that the equi-affine framework
	is compatible with the common model of population coding of the hand
	velocity vector when combined with a simple assumption on its dynamics.
	We then discuss several alternative explanations for the role that
	the equi-affine metric may play in internal representations of motion
	perception and production.},

  abstract = {1. When subjects trace patterns such as ellipses, the instantaneous
	velocity of movements is related to the instantaneous curvature of
	the trajectories according to a power law-movements tend to slow
	down when curvature is high and speed up when curvature is low. It
	has been proposed that this relationship is centrally planned. 2.
	The arm's muscle properties and dynamics can significantly affect
	kinematics. Even under isometric conditions, muscle mechanical properties
	can affect the development of muscle forces and torques. Without
	a model that accounts for these effects, it is difficult to distinguish
	between kinematic patterns that are attributable to central control
	and patterns that arise because of dynamics and muscle properties
	and are not represented in the underlying control signals. 3. In
	this paper we address the nature of the control signals that underlie
	movements that obey the power law. We use a numerical simulation
	of arm movement control based on the lambda version of the equilibrium
	point hypothesis. We demonstrate that simulated elliptical and circular
	movements, and elliptical force trajectories generated under isometric
	conditions, obey the power law even though there was no relation
	between curvature and speed in the modeled control signals. 4. We
	suggest that limb dynamics and muscle mechanics-specifically, the
	springlike properties of muscles-can contribute significantly to
	the emergence of the power law relationship in kinematics. Thus,
	without a model that accounts for these effects, care must be taken
	when making inferences about the nature of neural control.},

	movements are parts of the neural processes underlying the planning

	observed actions and play a functional role in visual mental imagery.
	However, the role of eye movements during imagined actions is still
	unknown. Here, we report the timing features of eye and arm pointing
	movements for nine healthy participants in four conditions: Executed
	movements with orientation saccades (Eyes Free) or with no saccades
	(Eyes Motionless), and Imagined movements with Eyes Free or with
	Eyes Motionless. The first result was a facilitation effect of saccades
	upon both executed and imagined arm movements as revealed by the
	shorter arm movement durations in Eyes Free than in Eyes Motionless.
	Another interesting finding was that executed and imagined movements
	preserved their temporal similarities in both Eyes Free and Eyes
	Motionless, suggesting that the accuracy of motor representations
	is not dependent on the presence or lack of eye movements. This result
	and the close similarities between the EOG patterns accompanying
	both executed and imagined arm pointing movements in Eyes Free, argue
	in favour of a similar neurocognitive network in executed and imagined
	actions. We propose that internal forward models provide fine estimations
	of the temporal features of imagined arm movements, whatever they
	accompanied, or not, by orientation saccades.},

	to curvature in drawing and hand-writing movements. The empirical
	relationship between these characteristics of motion and path is
	well described by a power law in which the velocity varies in proportion
	to the one-third power of the radius of curvature. It was recently
	shown that a similar relationship can be observed during locomotion
	along curved elliptical paths raising the possibility that these
	very different motor activities might, at some level, share the same
	planning strategies. It has, however, been noted that the ellipse
	is a special case with respect to the one-third power law and therefore
	these previous results might not provide strong evidence that the
	one-third power law is a general feature of locomotion around curved
	paths. For this reason the experimental study of locomotion and its
	comparison with hand writing is extended here to non-elliptical paths.
	Subjects walked along predefined curved paths consisting of two complex
	shapes drawn on the ground: the cloverleaf and the limacon. It was
	found that the data always supported a close relationship between
	instantaneous velocity and curvature. For these more complex paths,
	however, the relationship is shape-dependent--although velocity and
	curvature can still be linked by a power law, the exponent depends
	on the geometrical form of the path. The results demonstrate the
	existence of a close relationship between instantaneous velocity
	and curvature in locomotion that is more general than the one-third
	power law. The origins of this relationship and its possible explanation
	in the mechanical balance of forces and in central planning are discussed.},

	two-thirds power law. Here we show that the two-thirds power law
	holds also for the foot trajectory (during the swing phase) in human
	locomotion for a wide range of walking speeds and gravitational loads,
	but air-stepping. In air-stepping, it was violated systematically.
	The results suggest that the power law represents a general constrain
	of biological motion, may be attributed to both mechanical and neural
	factors and can depend on natural interactions with external environment.},

  abstract = {Monkeys traced spirals on a planar surface as unitary activity was
	recorded from either premotor or primary motor cortex. Using the
	population vector algorithm, the hand's trajectory could be accurately
	visualized with the cortical activity throughout the task. The time
	interval between this prediction and the corresponding movement varied
	linearly with the instantaneous radius of curvature; the prediction
	interval was longer when the path of the finger was more curved (smaller
	radius). The intervals in the premotor cortex fell into two groups,
	whereas those in the primary motor cortex formed a single group.
	This suggests that the change in prediction interval is a property
	of a single population in primary motor cortex, with the possibility
	that this outcome is due to the different properties generated by
	the simultaneous action of separate subpopulations in premotor cortex.
	Electromyographic (EMG) activity and joint kinematics were also measured
	in this task. These parameters varied harmonically throughout the
	task with many of the same characteristics as those of single cortical
	cells. Neither the lags between joint-angular velocities and hand
	velocity nor the lags between EMG and hand velocity could explain
	the changes in prediction interval between cortical activity and
	hand velocity. The simple spatial and temporal relationship between
	cortical activity and finger trajectory suggests that the figural
	aspects of this task are major components of cortical activity.},

	trajectory formation, from point-to-point movements to handwriting.
	The proposed model is based on a mechanism of composition of basic
	curve elements (strokes) which separates the spatial and the temporal
	aspects of trajectory formation. At the same time, the model suggests
	a method for storing and describing arm movements, as a list of stroke
	descriptors. Experimental trajectories were digitized and analyzed
	with regard to several types of movements: i) point-to-point trajectories,
	ii) closed trajectories, iii) trajectories with inflection points,
	iv) spiral-like trajectories, v) handwritten trajectories. Velocity
	and curvature profiles were computed for the trajectories and the
	model was fitted to the data. The implications of the model and its
	"credibility" in the general context of motor control are discussed.},

  abstract = {Mental imagery is a cognitive tool that helps humans take decisions
	by simulating past and future events. The hypothesis has been advanced
	that there is a functional equivalence between actual and mental
	movements. Yet, we do not know whether there are any limitations
	to its validity even in terms of some fundamental features of actual
	movements, such as the relationship between space and time. Although
	it is impossible to directly measure the spatiotemporal features
	of mental actions, an indirect investigation can be conducted by
	taking advantage of the constraints existing in planar drawing movements
	and described by the two-thirds power law (2/3PL). This kinematic
	law describes one of the most impressive regularities observed in
	biological movements: movement speed decreases when curvature increases.
	Here, we compared the duration of identical actual and mental arm
	movements by changing the constraints imposed by the 2/3PL. In the
	first two experiments, the length of the trajectory remained constant,
	while its curvature (Experiment 1) or its number of inflexions (Experiment
	2) was manipulated. The results showed that curvature, but not the
	number of inflexions, proportionally and similarly affected actual
	and mental movement duration, as expected from the 2/3PL. Two other
	control experiments confirmed that the results of Experiment 1 were
	not attributable to eye movements (Experiment 3) or to the perceived
	length of the displayed trajectory (Experiment 4). Altogether, our
	findings suggest that mental movement simulation is tuned to the
	kinematic laws characterizing actions and that kinematics of actual
	and mental movements is completely specified by the representation
	of their geometry.},

  abstract = {Several experiments have suggested that similar physiological substrates
	are involved in movement execution and motor imagery, and that the
	same laws of movement control apply to both processes. Using a mental
	chronometry paradigm, we examined the effects of movement direction
	and added mass on the duration of actual and imagined movements.
	Six subjects executed or imagined arm movements in the sagittal and
	horizontal plane, in three different loading conditions: without
	added mass, and with an added mass of 1 and 1.5 kg. The duration
	of both actual and imagined movements was measured by an electronic
	stopwatch. The actual movements were significantly increased in duration
	as a function of mass, for both movement directions. However, direction
	per se had no effect on duration. The duration of imagined movements
	was very similar to that of actual movements whatever the subject
	and mass and direction condition. These results show that both inertial
	and gravitational constraints are accurately incorporated in the
	timing of the motor imagery process, which appears therefore to be
	functionally very close to the process of planning and performing
	the actual movement.},

	relating Euclidean velocity to radius of curvature (R) in the generation
	and perception of planar movement. Although the relation between
	velocity and curvature is clear and very intuitive, no valid explanation
	for the specific 1/3 value has yet been found. We show that if instead
	of computing the Euclidean velocity we compute the affine one, a
	velocity which is invariant to affine transformations, then we obtain
	that the unique function of R which will give (constant) affine invariant
	velocity is precisely R1/3. This means that the 1/3 power law, experimentally
	found in the studies of hand-drawing and planar motion perception,
	implies motion at constant affine velocity. Since drawing/perceiving
	at constant affine velocity implies that curves of equal affine length
	will be drawn in equal time, we performed an experiment to further
	support this result. Results showed agreement between the 1/3 power
	law and drawing at constant affine velocity. Possible reasons for
	the appearance of affine transformations in the generation and perception
	of planar movement are discussed.},

  abstract = {Some studies suggest that complex arm movements in humans and monkeys
	may optimize several objective functions, while others claim that
	arm movements satisfy geometric constraints and are composed of elementary
	components. However, the ability to unify different constraints has
	remained an open question. The criterion for a maximally smooth (minimizing
	jerk) motion is satisfied for parabolic trajectories having constant
	equi-affine speed, which thus comply with the geometric constraint
	known as the two-thirds power law. Here we empirically test the hypothesis
	that parabolic segments provide a compact representation of spontaneous
	drawing movements. Monkey scribblings performed during a period of
	practice were recorded. Practiced hand paths could be approximated
	well by relatively long parabolic segments. Following practice, the
	orientations and spatial locations of the fitted parabolic segments
	could be drawn from only 2-4 clusters, and there was less discrepancy
	between the fitted parabolic segments and the executed paths. This
	enabled us to show that well-practiced spontaneous scribbling movements
	can be represented as sequences ("words") of a small number of elementary
	parabolic primitives ("letters"). A movement primitive can be defined
	as a movement entity that cannot be intentionally stopped before
	its completion. We found that in a well-trained monkey a movement
	was usually decelerated after receiving a reward, but it stopped
	only after the completion of a sequence composed of several parabolic
	segments. Piece-wise parabolic segments can be generated by applying
	affine geometric transformations to a single parabolic template.
	Thus, complex movements might be constructed by applying sequences
	of suitable geometric transformations to a few templates. Our findings
	therefore suggest that the motor system aims at achieving more parsimonious
	internal representations through practice, that parabolas serve as
	geometric primitives and that non-Euclidean variables are employed
	in internal movement representations (due to the special role of
	parabolas in equi-affine geometry).},

  abstract = {The 2/3 power law, the nonlinear relationship between tangential velocity
	and radius of curvature of the end-effector trajectory, is thought
	to be a fundamental constraint of the central nervous system in the
	formation of rhythmic endpoint trajectories. However, studies on
	the 2/3 power law have been confined largely to planar drawing patterns
	of relatively small size. With the hypothesis that this strategy
	overlooks nonlinear effects that are constitutive in movement generation,
	the present experiments tested the validity of the power law in elliptical
	patterns that were not confined to a planar surface and which were
	performed by the unconstrained 7-degrees of freedom (DOF) arm, with
	significant variations in pattern size and workspace orientation.
	Data were recorded from five human subjects where the seven joint
	angles and the endpoint trajectories were analyzed. Additionally,
	an anthropomorphic 7-DOF robot arm served as a "control subject"
	whose endpoint trajectories were generated on the basis of the human
	joint angle data, modeled as simple harmonic oscillations. Analyses
	of the endpoint trajectories demonstrate that the power law is systematically
	violated with increasing pattern size, in both exponent and the goodness
	of fit. The origins of these violations can be explained analytically
	based on smooth, rhythmic trajectory formation and the kinematic
	structure of the human arm. We conclude that, in unconstrained rhythmic
	movements, the power law seems to be a by-product of a movement system
	that favors smooth trajectories, and that it is unlikely to serve
	as a primary movement-generating principle. Our data rather suggest
	that subjects employed smooth oscillatory pattern generators in joint
	space to realize the required movement patterns.},

	computer monitor using the index finger. Each unit was recorded individually,
	and the responses collected from four hemispheres (3 primary motor
	and 1 dorsal premotor) were analyzed as a population. Population
	vectors constructed from this activity accurately and isomorphically
	represented the shape of the drawn figures showing that they represent
	the spatial aspect of the task well. These observations were extended
	by examining the temporal relation between this neural representation
	and finger displacement. Movements generated during this task were
	made in four kinematic segments. This segmentation was clearly evident
	in a time series of population vectors. In addition, the (2)/(3)
	power law described for human drawing was also evident in the neural
	correlate of the monkey hand trajectory. Movement direction and speed
	changed continuously during the task. Within each segment, speed
	and direction changed reciprocally. The prediction interval between
	the population vector and movement direction increased in the middle
	of the segments where curvature was high, but decreased in straight
	portions at the beginning and end of each segment. In contrast to
	direction, prediction intervals between the movement speed and population
	vector length were near-constant with only a modest modulation in
	each segment. Population vectors predicted direction (vector angle)
	and speed (vector length) throughout the drawing task. Joint angular
	velocity and arm muscle EMG were well correlated to hand direction,
	suggesting that kinematic and kinetic parameters are correlated in
	these tasks.},

  abstract = {During speech production, oral articulator points exhibit spatially
	complex trajectories. This spatial complexity is partially reflected
	in the trajectory's curvature history (where curvature is defined
	as the rate of change of direction, parameterized for arc length).
	Informal observation of articulatory movement reveals that an increase
	in the degree of trajectory curvature is often associated with a
	slowing of the articulator. Such a relation between the speed and
	curvature of movement has been quantified for a variety of behaviors
	within the limb and oculomotor systems. This relation has been called
	the 1/3 power law. Such an association has not been quantified for
	speech movements. If speech movements adhere to the 1/3 power law,
	it would imply a specific constraint on the variability in spatial
	complexity (as reflected by curvature) and the time course of speech-related
	movements. This study empirically evaluated the relationship between
	articulator speed and trajectory curvature for speech-related mid-sagittal
	planar movements of the tongue, lower lip and mandible in a group
	of healthy speakers. Results revealed that movement speed and trajectory
	curvature are related by a power function whose exponent is near,
	but not exactly 1/3. Articulators exhibited systematic variations
	in the strength of association, and value of the exponent. These
	results suggest that speed and curvature of speech movement covary
	in ways similar to other motor systems.},

  abstract = {A central problem in motor control is understanding how the many biomechanical
	degrees of freedom are coordinated to achieve a common goal. An especially
	puzzling aspect of coordination is that behavioral goals are achieved
	reliably and repeatedly with movements rarely reproducible in their
	detail. Existing theoretical frameworks emphasize either goal achievement
	or the richness of motor variability, but fail to reconcile the two.
	Here we propose an alternative theory based on stochastic optimal
	feedback control. We show that the optimal strategy in the face of
	uncertainty is to allow variability in redundant (task-irrelevant)
	dimensions. This strategy does not enforce a desired trajectory,
	but uses feedback more intelligently, correcting only those deviations
	that interfere with task goals. From this framework, task-constrained
	variability, goal-directed corrections, motor synergies, controlled
	parameters, simplifying rules and discrete coordination modes emerge
	naturally. We present experimental results from a range of motor
	tasks to support this theory.},

	Thus, a strong tendency exists to keep the execution time of these
