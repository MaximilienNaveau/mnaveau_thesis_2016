\subsection{Conclusion}

In this annexe we presented the dynamic filter, key algorithm for stable ground walking.
Firstly, we derived the theoretical aspect of the algorithm and secondly, we shown several technical aspect regarding the implementation.
This annexe has for main purpose to express the tricks and details of the implementation of the dynamical filter.
This should provide a good guide for someone willing to implement this algorithm.
