\section{Conclusion and future works}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have proposed an original formulation to efficiently generate walking pattern generator for any multi-contact configurations. The walking pattern generator is written as a nonlinear optimal control problem, which can be solved very efficiently, leading to real-time capabilities. While building an efficient problem, we kept the formulation as generic as possible, by comparing and justifying every technical choice with respect to several other formulations proposed in the state of the art. The few arbitrary modeling choices that were taken are clearly exhibited and might be the topic of future research. For example, a future direction may be to express more clever bounds for the angular momentum.

We also shown how to integrate this walking pattern generator in a complete implementation, by using a contact planner to compute the reference contact sequence. The dynamically-consistent whole-body trajectory is finally obtained by performing a second-order inverse kinematics using the COM references of the pattern generator and the posture and limbs movements from the planner. The complete pipeline is real-time on the demonstrated examples and in most of the classical situation that a robot could meet in a factory. The maturity of the approach was demonstrated by two real executions with the HRP-2 robot and another example in simulation.
