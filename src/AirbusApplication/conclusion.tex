\section{Conclusion}
In this PoC we proved that the robot HRP-2 is able to evolve in an environment with moving objects such as a toolbox pushed by a human. 
We have shown that using a localization system whole body motion and goal driven walking can be performed.
We proved that the robot was able to go through stairs cases with industrial tools in its grippers.

The current limitation of the system is the complexity 
of the environment and the large space of possible motion for the robot.
With the current setup on which we agree for the PoC the current techniques seem applicable.
It is however possible to improve the speed of the robot and try the next level where the robot is really trying to perform the screwing action.
We are looking forward to continue this line of action by trying more challenging environment and motion.
